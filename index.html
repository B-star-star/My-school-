            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance. Manually taking attendance and registering it in files and musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.To overcome such inefficient work processes, Activity high school came up with a software to reduce manual work. </p>
